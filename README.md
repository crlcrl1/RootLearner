# RootLearner

RootLearner is a simple application to learn roots for course English Words in Culture Context in PKU.

## Why?

Although there is already some application for the course, they are not perfect. What I want to do is to write a better application to make learning roots easier and more efficient.

## What?

RootLearner is a root-learning application using Qt to develop. You can either learn roots or learn words along with roots using this app. You can also chose the range you want to learn according to letter or page. As Qt is multi-platform, it is available on nearly all platform including Windows, MacOS, Linux and Android.
